.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rsvndump
is a command line tool to dump a subversion repository that resides on a remote server. All data is dumped in the format that can be read and written by the svnadmin(1) command, so the data produced by
.B rsvndump
can easily be imported into a new subversion repository.
.PP
However, since
.B rsvndump
allows you to dump only there are quite a few differences to a normal dump:

   - Revision numbers are not synced with the remote repository but are simply counted, starting from 1. 
   - The url that has been specified serves as the new repository url. This means that it will be stripped from every directory and file. 

.B rsvndump
provides an offline and an online mode and defaults to offline mode. See below for a detailed description and comparison of the modes.
.SH OPTIONS
Options in brackets are provided as synonyms:
.TP
.B "-h [--help]"
print a nice help screen
.TP
.B "-q [--quiet]"
be quiet
.TP
.B "-v [--verbose]"
print extra progress. This is not very expressive in offline mode.
.TP 
.BI "-u [--username]"\ username
username for repository authentication.
.br
If not specified and the repository does not provide anonymous access, the name of the user that has run
.B rsvndump
if used. If repository access is still blocked, 
.B rsvndump
will ask for the username
If not specified and the given url is not a public repository,
.B rsvndump
will ask for the username on 
.I stdin.   
.br
Be sure to provide a valid username when providing the log data via
.I stdin
, because the username might be taken from the log data.
.TP
.BI "-p {--password]"\ password
password for repository authentication.
.br
If not specified and the given url does not provide anonymous read access,
.B rsvndump
will ask for the password.
.TP
.BI "-l [--logfile]"\ logfile
subversion log file to be used. This file should contain the output of
.B svn -q -r 0:HEAD log 
.I url
.br
If not specified, the subversion log data is read from stdin.
.TP
.BI "-o [--outfile]"\ outfile
output file for the dumped data.
.br
If not specified,
.B rsvndump
will write all dumped data to
.I stdout.
.TP
.B "-d [--download-dir]"\ dir
directory where the working svn copy will be stored. 
.br
A working copy will only be used when dumping in offline mode (see below for details).
If not specified,
.B rsvndump
will create a temporary directory inside the system-wide temporary directory.
This directory will be cleared if the program exits.
.TP
.B --online
run in online mode as described below.
.SH ONLINE/OFFLINE MODE
By default,
.B rsvndump
uses the offline mode, which means that a working
copy of the repository is kept at the local disk. The copy is then updated
to every revision specified in the logfile, and all information is fetched
using the copy. This provides a fast dump for really remote repositories,
because all data can be transfered at once. 
.PP
However, if you want to dump a repository in your local network that does
not consist of very much files per change, online mode will propably be faster than
offline mode. In online mode, all information is fetched directly from the
repository and no additional data is stored on the local hard disk.
.SH NOTES
Unlike svn(1),
.B rsvndump
does not save passwords or SSL certifactes on disk for later authentication. Thus, passwords must be entered or specified everytime the program is run. The same is true for accepting SSL certificates.
.SH BUGS 
Currently, it seems like there is a memory leak when dumping a repository from an apache server. All other dumps run fine without any leaks, so maybe there is a bug inside one of the underlying libraries.
