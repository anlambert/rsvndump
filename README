rsvndump 0.4.4
Copyright (C) 2008-2009 by Jonas Gehring


ABOUT
=====
rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a subversion repository
that resides on a remote server. All data is dumped in the format that can be
read/written by svnadmin, so the data produced by rsvndump can easily be
imported into a new subversion repository.


REQUIREMENTS
============
rsvndump depends on Subversion, which depends on the Apache Portable Runtinme.
Therefore, to build rsvndump from source, the development and runtime files
(headers and libraries) of both libraries must be present on the system.


USAGE
=====
For usage information, please refer to the man page shipped with this package.
Less detailed usage information can also be retrieved by passing the '--help'
argument to the program
