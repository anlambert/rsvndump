The 'incremental' test will most likely not succeeed, because the incremental
dump is unable to determine file modifications. Thus, the file dir1/file2
will be dumped with all its content, just to be sure there's no modification
missing. The diff will look like:

	@@ -170,6 +170,13 @@

This needs to be integrated into the test itself, of course
