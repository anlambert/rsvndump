This is a small test suite for rsvndump, implemented in python.

Each test is implemented as a python module, placed in tests/ if it should be
run automatically using the toplevel 'run_all.sh' script.

A test must at least provide the following functions:

	- info():
	  Returns a string describing the test
	- modify_tree(step, logfile): 
	  Modifies the tree of a Subversion working copy, according to the
	  given step. Commands like "svn add" can be run using the run
	  funciton of the run package (import run from run).
	  This command returns 0 if step is larger than the number of steps
	  for this specific test, or 1 else.

Additionally, a test can provide the following functions. Please note that
if these functions are provided, they will be used.

	- dump_dir():
	  Returns a string describing the path inside the repository
	  that is going to be dumped. If this function isn't provided,
	  the complete repositry will be dumped. The --dump-uuid option
	  be passed to rsvndump only if this function isn't provided
	- write_reference_dump(dumpfile, logfile):
	  If this function is provided, "svnadmin dump" will not be invoked.
	  After using rsvndump, the dump provided by rsvndump will simply be
	  diffed against the file whose name has been given to this function.
	- preprocess_dump(dumpfile, logfile):
	  This is called after the original reference dump has been created
	  (unless write_reference_dump is preset) to allow the test to modify
	  the reference dump file
