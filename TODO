== 0.5 branch (deltas) ==
> Validate copy handling
> Don't start with an empty revision in dump_do_diff() if --incremental is given
> Don't dump the uuid if --incremental is given and we aren't starting at 0
> Implement --keep-revnums
> MD5-sums for deltas


== Schedule for 0.4.5 ==
> Replace commands that are deprecated in Subversion 1.6.1
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"


== Schedule for 0.5 ==
> Rename --download-dir option to --wc-dir (and -d to -w)
> Remove --outfile option
> Use deltas in diffs
> Proper range specification, i.e. like svnadmin's -r START:STOP
> Incremental dumps:
  The revision map needs to be fetched prior to dumping then
> Write more automated tests


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> File-not-found if invoking rsvndump on a subdirectory with --stop 0
> Retries if connection is lost
> Option: don't stop on copy
> Incremental (is hard because revision map is missing)
