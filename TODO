== 0.5 branch (deltas) ==
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1)
> Don't dump node contents if it is a copy and has not changed (we need
  to keep track of the MD5-sums for this)
> Don't start with an empty revision in dump_do_diff() if --incremental is given
> Don't dump the uuid if --incremental is given and we aren't starting at 0
> Implement --keep-revnums
> MD5-sums for deltas
> In close_edit, delete the temporary files for nodes that have been deleted
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed
> Manually output revision 0 if we're dumping a subdirectory
> Replace APPNAME in svn_handle_errror2 with _("ERROR")

> Further validate copy handling and subdirectory dumping

> Rewrite manpage
> Check compilation with svn 1.6, 1.5 and 1.4


== Schedule for 0.4.5 ==
> Replace commands that are deprecated in Subversion 1.6.1
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"


== Schedule for 0.5.1 ==
> Re-implement dumping of single files?


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> File-not-found if invoking rsvndump on a subdirectory with --stop 0
> Retries if connection is lost
> Option: don't stop on copy
> Incremental (is hard because revision map is missing)
