== 0.5 branch (deltas) ==
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1). This is problematic
  with replace-actions. See copy_replace test.
> Add a test for --prefix
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed
> --dump-uuid as default?
> Make the '-r'-specifier more like svnadmin (maybe)

> Further validate copy handling and subdirectory dumping

> Rewrite manpage:
  - Add notes about the resulting revision numbers, using example combinations of
    subdirectories, --keep-revnums, -r X:Y and --incremental
> Check compilation with svn 1.6, 1.5 and 1.4


== Schedule for 0.5.X ==
> Add --no-stop-on-copy option
> Re-implement dumping of single files?
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"
> Don't dump node contents if it is a copy and has not changed (we need
  to keep track of the MD5-sums for this)
> MD5-sums for deltas
> Specify MD5 for copy source on copying


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> Retries if connection is lost
