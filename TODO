== 0.5 branch (deltas) ==
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1). This is problematic
  with replace-actions. See copy_replace test.
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed
> Replace unlink()-calls with apr_file_remove()

> Further validate copy handling and subdirectory dumping

> Rewrite manpage:
  - Add notes about the resulting revision numbers, using example combinations of
    subdirectories, --keep-revnums, -r X:Y and --incremental


== Schedule for 0.5.X ==
> Add --no-stop-on-copy option
> Re-implement dumping of single files?
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"
> Specify MD5 for copy source on copying
> Optimize delta dumps (i.e., don't apply delta -> generate delta ->
    read delta).


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> Retries if connection is lost
> Make the '-r'-specifier more like svnadmin (maybe)
