== 0.5 branch (deltas) ==
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1). This is problematic
  with replace-actions. See copy_replace test.
> Don't dump node contents if it is a copy and has not changed (we need
  to keep track of the MD5-sums for this)
> Add a test for --prefix
> MD5-sums for deltas
> Specify MD5 for copy source on copying
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed
> When cloning the changed_paths hash in log_receiver, we can ignore paths that don't
  start with a '/'
> --dump-uuid as default?
> Don't allow --keep-revnums if not root or prefix
> Don't copy revision 0 manually (svnadmin doesn't do it, too)
> Make the '-r'-specifier more like svnadmin (maybe)
> Correct SSL certificate handling (i.e., offer option to accept permanetly)

> Further validate copy handling and subdirectory dumping

> Add --no-stop-on-copy
> Rewrite manpage:
  - Add notes about the resulting revision numbers, using example combinations of
    subdirectories, --keep-revnums, -r X:Y and --incremental
> Check compilation with svn 1.6, 1.5 and 1.4


== Schedule for 0.4.5 ==
> Replace commands that are deprecated in Subversion 1.6.1
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"


== Schedule for 0.5.1 ==
> Re-implement dumping of single files?


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> File-not-found if invoking rsvndump on a subdirectory with --stop 0
> Retries if connection is lost
> Option: don't stop on copy
> Incremental (is hard because revision map is missing)
