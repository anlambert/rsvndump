== 0.5 branch (deltas) ==
> --incremental does not start correctly... maybe we need to record the previous stuff as well,
  but just don't dump it? Alternatevily, we could fetch everything from the previous revision
  if we aren't in delta mode
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1)
> Don't dump node contents if it is a copy and has not changed (we need
  to keep track of the MD5-sums for this)
> Don't start with an empty revision in dump_do_diff() if --incremental is given
> Implement --keep-revnums
> MD5-sums for deltas
> In close_edit, delete the temporary files for nodes that have been deleted
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed
> Replace APPNAME in svn_handle_errror2 with _("ERROR")

> Further validate copy handling and subdirectory dumping

> Rewrite manpage
> Check compilation with svn 1.6, 1.5 and 1.4


== Schedule for 0.4.5 ==
> Replace commands that are deprecated in Subversion 1.6.1
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"


== Schedule for 0.5.1 ==
> Re-implement dumping of single files?


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> File-not-found if invoking rsvndump on a subdirectory with --stop 0
> Retries if connection is lost
> Option: don't stop on copy
> Incremental (is hard because revision map is missing)
