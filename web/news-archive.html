        <li><h4>October 8th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.2 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This is a bugfix
        release, fixing a segmentation fault that could occur when using the new
        <i>--keep-revnums</i> flag.<br />
        A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is available
        as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages
        have been updated, too.</p></li>

        <li><h4>October 5th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4.1 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This release includes new features, mainly a command line option to keep
        revision numbers in sync with the source repository by adding empty
        revisions for padding. This is useful when dumping a sub-path without
        changing revision numbers. Adidtionally, a bug preventing a single file to
        be dumped in offline mode when using the <i>--quiet</i> flag has been
        fixed.<br />

        <li><h4>October 1st, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4 is now available as a
        <a href="index.html#content">Debian package</a> for x86 and ARM processors.
        Both packages have been generated on Debian Etch and should also work on
        Ubuntu.</p></li>

        <li><h4>September 29th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.4 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This release includes new features as well as bugfixes and is actually
        a complete rewrite of the program. The major changes include automatic log
        history fetching, heavy speed improvements for both online and offline mode
        and a more convenient ./configure script with proper checks for the Apache
        Runtime libraries.<br />

        <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is available
        as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.</p>
        <p>Additionally, rsvndump is now released under the GNU General Public
        License, Version 3, which was needed because some autoconf macros which
        are used by rsvndump have been licensed under the Apache License, Version
        2.0. This license is incompatible to the GPLv2, so I upgraded to the
        compatible GPLv3.</p></li>

        <li><h4>September 8th, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.3.2 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This is mainly a bugfix release, fixing a memory leak due to long-living
        memory pools. Additionally, changes were made to the node dumping order.<br />

        <li><h4>September 3rd, 2008</h4>
        <p>I updated the README to reflect the dependencies of rsvndump
        (Subversion and Apache Portable Runtime).</p></li>

        <li><h4>September 1st, 2008</h4>
        <p>rsvndump 0.3.1 is now <a href="index.html#content">available</a>.
        This is mainly a bugfix release, fixing two issues regarding copy resolving
        and a memory leak. As an additional feature, the dumped data can be prefixed
        with a custom string now.<br />
