		<title>rsvndump - remote Subversion repository dump</title>
	</head>

		<h2><p align="center">Welcome to the rsvndump web page!</p></h2>

		<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a Subversion repository that resides on a remote server.
		All data is dumped in the format that can be read an written by <i>svnadmin load/dump</i>, so the data which is produced
		can easily be imported into a new Subversion repository.</p>
		<p>There are scenarios in which it might be better to use <i>svnsync</i> and <i>svnadmin dump</i> to perform the dump than to use
		rsvndump. The reason for this is that these tools are officialy distributed with Subversion and might be more feature-complete than rsvndump.<br />
		To make it more easier to decide whether to use rsvndump, here's a short comparison of the two solutions for remote repository dumps:</p>

			<tr><td valign="top">Handle all Subversion protocols (svn://, https://, file:// etc.)</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Dump a whole repository</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Dump a sub-directory of a repository</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">only with server running Subversion &gt;= 1.5</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Dump a sub-directory of a repository<br />with read access limited to this directory</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Officially distributed by the Subversion developers</td><td valign="top">no</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr>
		</table>
		</p>
		<p>Actually, the "Dump a sub-directory of a repository" can be accomplished with the <i>svnsync</i>+<i>svnadmin dump</i> solution on Subversion servers
		prior to 1.5, too, by using <i>svndumpfilter</i> on the resulting dump. However, this has the downside that the whole repository data has to be
		transferred while using <i>svnsync</i>. Additionally, it might not be possible to extract the sub-directory using <i>svndumpfilter</i> due to
		copies from a directory outside the one that is going to be extracted.</p>
		<p>rsvndump is written in C and built on top of the Subversion API, so it can offer all functionality needed to access a Subversion
		repository, including SSL authentication and support for all of Subversion's protocols (svn://, http://, file:// etc.). And it's GPLed.</p>

		<h3>NEWS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><h4>April 15th, 2009</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4.4-1 is now <a href="#content">available</a>, fixing build issues with Subversion 1.6.1. Please note that you will see
			warnings about deprecated functions when compiling the package, but it should build without errors.<br />
			As usual, the source package is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated, too.</p></li>

			<li><h4>March 30th, 2009</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4.4 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This release adds a command line option to disable the need for manually
			accepting a SSL certificate (<i>--no-check-certificate</i>), which is useful when calling rsvndump from within a script. Additionally,
			the program has been made translatable using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">GNU gettext</a>. A German translation of
			all output strings is already included.<br />
			As usual, the source package is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated, too.</p></li>

			<li><h4>November 21th, 2008</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4.3 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This release includes new features as well as bugfixes: the
			command line option <i>--dump-uuid</i> has been added, which dumps the uuid of a repository and is useful
			if repositories should be cloned. A bug which could occur when dumping a sub-directory via a file://-url has been fixed. As
			a minor change, the svn dump format produces has been changed to version "2" because <i>svndumpfilter</i> refuses to read dump
			files with format "3" in current versions (currently, this does not affect the rsvndump's output except for a number at the
			start).<br />
			A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
			available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated, too.</p></li>

			<li><h4>October 8th, 2008</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4.2 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This is a bugfix release, fixing a segmentation fault that could occur
