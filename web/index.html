		<title>rsvndump - remote Subversion repository dump</title>
	</head>

		<h2><p align="center">Welcome to the rsvndump web page!</p></h2>

		<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a Subversion repository that resides on a remote server.
		All data is dumped in the format that can be read an written by <i>svnadmin load/dump</i>, so the data which is produced
		can easily be imported into a new Subversion repository.</p>
		<p>There are scenarios in which it might be better to use <i>svnsync</i> and <i>svnadmin dump</i> to perform the dump than to use
		rsvndump. The reason for this is that these tools are officialy distributed with Subversion and might be more feature-complete than rsvndump.<br />
		To make it more easier to decide whether to use rsvndump, here's a short comparison of the two solutions for remote repository dumps:</p>

			<tr><td valign="top"><b>Feature</b></td><td valign="top" width="20%"><b>rsvndump</b></td><td valign="top" width="35%"><b>svnsync</b>+<b>svnadmin dump</b></td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Handle all Subversion protocols (svn://, https://, file:// etc.)</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Dump a whole repository</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Dump a sub-directory of a repository</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">only with server running Subversion &gt;= 1.5</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Dump a sub-directory of a repository<br />with read access limited to this directory</td><td valign="top">yes</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top">Officially distributed by the Subversion developers</td><td valign="top">no</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr>
		</table>
		</p>
		<p>Actually, the "Dump a sub-directory of a repository" can be accomplished with the <i>svnsync</i>+<i>svnadmin dump</i> solution on Subversion servers
		prior to 1.5, too, by using <i>svndumpfilter</i> on the resulting dump. However, this has the downside that the whole repository data has to be
		transferred while using <i>svnsync</i>. Additionally, it might not be possible to extract the sub-directory using <i>svndumpfilter</i> due to
		copies from a directory outside the one that is going to be extracted.</p>
		<p>rsvndump is written in C and built on top of the Subversion API, so it can offer all functionality needed to access a Subversion
		repository, including SSL authentication and support for all of Subversion's protocols (svn://, http://, file:// etc.). And it's GPLed.</p>

		<h3>NEWS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><h4>October 27th, 2008</h4>
			<p>I updated the ABOUT-section on this web page, and there's now a <a href="news-archive.html">seperate page</a> which serves as
			a news archive. Only the 5 latest news items will be displayed on the main page now.</p>

			<li><h4>October 8th, 2008</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4.2 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This is a bugfix release, fixing a segmentation fault that could occur
			when using the new <i>&#150;&#150;keep&#150;revnums</i> flag.<br />
			A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
			available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated, too.</li>

			<li><h4>October 5th, 2008</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4.1 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This release includes new features, mainly a command line option to
			keep revision numbers in sync with the source repository by adding empty revisions for padding. This is useful when dumping
			a sub-path without changing revision numbers. Adidtionally, a bug preventing a single file to be dumped in offline
			mode when using the <i>&#150;&#150;quiet</i> flag has been fixed.<br />
			A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
			available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2. The Debian packages have been updated, too.</li>

			<li><h4>October 1st, 2008</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4 is now available as a <a href="#content">Debian package</a> for x86 and ARM processors. Both packages have been
			generated on Debian Etch and should also work on Ubuntu.</p></li>

			<li><h4>September 29th, 2008</h4>
			<p>rsvndump 0.4 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This release includes new features as well as bugfixes and is actually
			a complete rewrite of the program. The major changes include automatic log history fetching, heavy speed improvements for both
			online and offline mode and a more convenient ./configure script with proper checks for the Apache Runtime libraries.<br />
			A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
			available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2.</p>
			<p>Additionally, rsvndump is now released under the GNU General Public License, Version 3, which was needed because some autoconf macros which 
			are used by rsvndump have been licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This license is incompatible to the GPLv2, so
			I upgraded to the compatible GPLv3.</p></li>
