		<title>rsvndump - remote svn repository dump</title>
	</head>

		<h3>ABOUT</h3>
		<p>rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a Subversion repository that resides on a remote server.
		All data is dumped in the format that can be read an written by <i>svnadmin dump</i>, so the data which is produced
		can easily be importerd into a new Subversion repository.</p>
		<p>Actually, a remote dump can be done using <i>svnsync</i> and <i>svnadmin dump</i> on the locally synced repository. However, 
		if the remote server does not run Subversion 1.5 or later, <i>svnsync</i> is unable to dump subdirectories of a repository only. This can
		be solved by syncing the whole repository and using <i>svndumpfilter</i> afterwards, but data of other subdirectories needs to be transferred over the network
		for no reason. And if you don't have access to the repository root, the whole thing will not work.</p>
		<p>Long story short: If you want to dump a subdirectory of a remote repository which runs a version of Subversion prior to 1.5, this 
		is the right tool for you. If not, please consider using <i>svnsync</i>.</p>
		<p>rsvndump is written in C and built on top of the Subversion API, so it can offer all functionality needed to access a Subversion
		repository, including SSL authentication. And it's GPLed.</p>
