        <a name="about"><h3>About</h3></a>
        <p>rsvndump is a command line tool that is able to dump a
        Subversion repository that resides on a remote server.
        All data is dumped in the format that can be read an written by
        <i>svnadmin load/dump</i>, so the data which is produced
        can easily be imported into a new Subversion repository.</p>

        <p>rsvndump supports most of the functionality of the normal
        <i>svn</i> client program and <i>svnadmin</i>, e.g. authentication,
        SSL-support, incremental dumps and support for dumping text
        deltas instead of full text.</p>

        <p>Additionally, rsvndump is able to dump only a subdirectory of a
        repository, even without read access to the root directory. This may
        work better than using <i>svndumpfilter</i> on an already existing
        dump, since copy actions are resolved during the dump process
        and replaced by normal file additions as needed.</p>

        <p>Further information about rsvndump's behavior and possible
        differences to the output generated by <i>svnadmin dump</i>
        can be found at the <a href="manpage.html">man page</a>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><h4>March 3rd, 2011</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.5 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
          release fixes a bug introduced in 0.5.3 
          (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2997558&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2997558</a>)
          which could led to crashes when dumping a
          subdirectory. Additionally, performance issues caused by
          unnecessary stats for copied revisions have been fixed. The
          full list of changes can be found in the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
          is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
          well as in zip format.<br />

          <li><h4>February 13th, 2011</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.4 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
          release mainly fixes dumping with text deltas. In previous versions,
          the delta didn't work and the full file content would be dumped in
          svndiff format. Please note that these dumps could be imported just
          fine and resulted in correct repositories.
          Additionally, support for the <tt>--config-dir</tt> option of the
          normal <i>svn</i> command-line client has been added, and a couple
          of minor issues have been fixed. The build instructions for Windows
          have been updated, too.
          The full list of changes can be found in the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
          is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
          well as in zip format.<br />

          <li><h4>December 15th, 2009</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.3 is now <a href="#content">available</a>. This
          release fixes a couple of serious bugs reported via the
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=1143180&group_id=268687">bug tracker</a>
          at SourceForge, including a bug that could prevent directory
          properties from being dumped
          (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2898815&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2898815</a>).
          Additionally, detection for paths affected by directory copy
          operations has been added. This fixes the generation of unloadable 
          dumps observed in specific cases (as reported in
          <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2898487&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">#2898487</a>
          by lordnightwalker). Dumping root node modifications has been fixed,
          too.
          The full list of the changes can be found in the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. The source package is
          is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
          well as in zip format.<br />
          Please note that the Debian packages haven't been updated (and are
          unlikely to be updated again). Please refer to the
          source tarball instead.

          <li><h4>July 17th, 2009</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.2 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
          fixing wrong Node-copyfrom-rev revision numbers when dumping subdirectories,
          as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2820774&group_id=268687&atid=1143180">reported in #2820774 by poeml</a>.
          Furthermore, a possible segmentation fault when dumping in incremental mode
          and starting at revision 1 has been fixed.
          A more detailed description of the changes can be found in the
          <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>. As usual, the source package is
          is available as a tarball compressed using either gzip or bzip2 as
          well as in zip format. The Debian packages have been updated, too.<br />
          I should also note that for practical reason, the <i>downloads archive</i>
          has been replaced by a simple link to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rsvndump/files/">files available at SourceForge</a>,
          as I've uploaded all previous releases via the file release system.

          <li><h4>July 11th, 2009</h4>
          <p>rsvndump 0.5.1 is now <a href="#content">available</a>,
          fixing a bug that caused properties to get dropped silently and some
          memory leaks. Additionally, rsvndump will now build successfully using
          the MSVC compiler on Windows. A corresponding CodeBlocks project file
          is included in the source distribution, which is now available in zip
          format, too.<br />
