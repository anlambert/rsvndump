== Schedule for 0.5.1 ==
> In delta.c:delta_cat_file. Why allocate 512 on every run if it is needed only on errors?
> More test cases for new property handling (extend props test):
  > Are properties saved accross moves, copies etc.?


== Schedule for 0.5.x ==
> Add --no-stop-on-copy option
> Check if revision range determnination can be done faster
> Re-implement dumping of single files?
> Output help on missing arguments, i.e. s.th. like "rsvndump --stop"
> Specify MD5 for copy source on copying
> Optimize delta dumps (i.e., don't apply delta -> generate delta ->
    read delta).
> It seems the copyfrom-revision is sometimes too large (+1). This is problematic
  with replace-actions, but needs further evaluation
> The svn:merginfo property will sometimes be dumped too early (-1). Not sure
  if this can be fixed


== Someday ==
> Dump user prefix in first revision, even with --keep-revnums
> Retries if connection is lost
> Make the '-r'-specifier more like svnadmin (maybe)
